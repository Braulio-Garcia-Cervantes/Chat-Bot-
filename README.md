# Chat-Bot-
 Virtual Chat Bot that users can interact with on a deeper level, as the bot is trained to analyze user sentiment.
    - Object-Oriented Design 
    - Machine Learning (intent recognition, entity recognition)
    - Created an API via FastAPI, that with each call, analyzes sentiments in the user response and ranks them with a positivity or negativity score. This will determine the appropriate bot response.
